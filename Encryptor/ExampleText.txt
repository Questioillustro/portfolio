I woke up today with nothing to say
My bed felt so comfortable
I slept the day away
Noon came and went as I drifted in dreams
Sunset colors faded to black
And still I slept
As I slept
I dreamt of darkness saying
“I’m waiting for you in the black
Thoughts and comfortable
Dreams
And when you wake I will take you away.”
