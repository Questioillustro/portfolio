Name: Stephen Brewster

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2.5 hours
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
1. Study general aspects of ruby to get a feel for the syntax
2. Move through  the requirements point by point and develop the script incrementally
3. Find opportunities to factor out code into generalized functions
4. Study specific Ruby functions as required
5. Test with provided .txt files

Complete
Actual Time	3.5 hours
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
1. Learned a great deal about Ruby
2. No notable problems encountered
3. Developed a basic solution to get a hash of words and their counts, then began moving through the steps provided
4. Completed 1 hour later than expected, but mostly due to taking extra time with studying Ruby
