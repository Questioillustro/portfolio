SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - LongestLine

Name: Stephen Brewster

================================================================
Part 1

Start
Estimated Time	45 minutes
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
1. Create bash scripts to compile, run, and track the program
    1.1 Commit
2. Implement readline to echo the lines as they are read in
    2.1 Update this document and submit

Complete
Actual Time	35 minutes
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Compilation errors : 1
Made a fancy pants bash script that compiles and runs the executable, also
appends errors to a log file and tallies the total compilation errors. 
No real problems encountered in C, most of the time for this part was spent
studying bash. Completed much faster than expected, found information I was
looking for quickly and had no troubles with implementing the readline method.

================================================================

Part 2 

Start
Estimated Time 15 minutes
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
1. After a line is read, compare its length to the current longest
2. If a higher length string is found -> set new highest length and copy
3. Implement copy method
4. Update this document and submit

Complete
Actual Time	20 minutes
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Compilation errors : 1
Fairly trivial to implement. Took more time than expected to ensure the MAXLINE
was enforced and added test to cover it. Overall only 2 compilation errors for 
both parts so that was good. Learned some fun tricks with bash scripting and 
gained confidence in C syntax and its finicky nature.
