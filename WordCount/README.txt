SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Python - WordCount

Name: Stephen Brewster

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	30 minutes
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
1. Refresh knowledge of python syntax, specifically researching how to receive input from stdin and string manipulation
2. Form a design that will meet the requirements of the project
3. Implement the program step by step:
	a. ensure the text from the file provided in the CLI command is available in the script
	b. parse the text from the file and count the necessary components (lines, words, characters)
4. Test by comparing the results with the wc unix command

Complete
Actual Time 40 minutes	
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
1. Successfully researched the necessary knowledge required to link unix commands to python scripts
2. Design and Implementation were fairly simple once necessary prequisite knowledge was attained
3. Struggled slightly with finding the python/unix help that I was looking for
