SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Python - Palindrome

Name: Stephen Brewster

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time: 40 minutes 	
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
1. Design palindrome testing script to use the 3 required methods
2. Implement step by step, first ensuring that both advance and retreat functions work as intended
3. Integrate all methods to generate a final boolean result (isPalindrome)
4. Generate test cases that probe the boundaries of strings which may cause bugs to arise

Complete
Actual Time	1 hour 45 minutes
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
1. Multiple problems with python-vim interaction, attempting to cut/paste code throws off the indentation
2. Difficulty with unknown bugs that were ultimately resolved by rewriting the same code!
3. Finished the bulk of the work in the estimated time, then spent extra time dealing with vim/python problems
4. Learned a lot about how to work with vim and python, but there's a great deal more if I'm going to be efficient
